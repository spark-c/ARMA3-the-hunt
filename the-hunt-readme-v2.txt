**Context / Map**

The game takes place on the map Malden, primarily on the island to the Southeast of the mainland. Game map can be found as a pinned message in this channel. Points of interest include:
- BLUFOR SPAWN, SE harbor of mainland.
- LANDING HARBOR on the game island. There are quadbikes for Blufor. This is the BLUFOR RESPAWN point.
- OPFOR SPAWN, military base on the Western part of the game island, East of the landing harbor. Quadbikes here.
- Additional quadbikes located on several peninsulae across the island, all marked on the map.
- OBJECTIVES 1 and 2 marked on the map. These are ammo caches to be destroyed by Opfor with satchel charges.
- a BONUS OBJECTIVE, to be destroyed early by Opfor.
- a HELI RESUPPLY point, just West of the Bonus Objective. Landing next to this point will replenish heli fuel and ammo.
- a GOODIE STASH full of ammunition, explosives, useful equipment, and quadbikes. Guarded by a small team of neutral AI troops nearby.
- an EXPLOSIVES DROP located at the far Northeast tip of the island, a cache with satchel charges. This is the OPFOR RESPAWN point.
- a speedboat with limited ammunition directly adjacent to the explosives drop, marked on the map.




**Rules**

- The game will end after 30 minutes.
- The supply cache at OPFOR SPAWN may not be accessed by BLUFOR troops.
- If OPFOR troops come close to the LANDING HARBOR, all players will receive a tip that OPFOR are present within the area. Another tip will appear as OPFOR leave the zone.
- Players who are killed may be revived by a teammate within 5 minutes of their death.

*Respawn Rules*
- BLUFOR begins with 2 respawn tickets. Opfor begins with 1 respawn ticket.
- BLUFOR players will respawn after 5 minutes, providing that there is a respawn ticket available. OPFOR players respawn after 2.5 minutes.
- Players respawn with their original loadout.
- Players of both teams are notified of the new ticket count upon respawn.
- While dead, players will be able to spectate their teammate(s) in 1st Person.

*Objective Rules*
- At the start of the game, Objectives 1 and 2 will be locked. They may not be destroyed until they are unlocked.
- These main objectives will automatically unlock after 5 minutes have passed, *OR* upon the destruction of the Bonus Objective, whichever is earliest.




**Win Conditions**

OPFOR may win by:
- Destroying both Objective 1 and Objective 2 before time runs out, or
- Eliminating all BLUFOR troops. If all BLUFOR troops are dead at the same time--even if there are respawns remaining--OPFOR will win.

BLUFOR may win by:
- Successfully defending at least one Objective until the time runs out, or
- Eliminating all OPFOR troops AND respawn tickets.

*NOTE*
The playable area extends some distance beyond the land of the game island - around X meters. If at any given point a team has no players within the playable area, it will count as a loss.
